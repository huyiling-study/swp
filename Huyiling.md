- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Huyiling, A sophomore student with a strong interest in front-end development. I am Familiar with CSS3, HTML5, Less, Sass, JavaScript, and Vue3. I am also experienced in using software development tools like VSCode, VueTools, and Git, as well as web debugging tools.

Furthermore, I have knowledge of Node.js and webpack packaging. I have also completed a self-initiated back-end management project using Vue3, which includes modules such as login, user management, role management, permission management, and menu management. For the project, I used Less for style writing and Axios for front-end and back-end data exchange.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a fast learner and adept at problem-solving. I work well with others, and I am adaptable to team culture and environment.
